Portfolio Website
A personal portfolio project built with Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS, showcasing my front-end development skills, resume, and technical expertise. The project is written in TypeScript and optimized for performance using React best practices. It includes smooth animations with AOS, UI icons from Font Awesome, and user notifications via React Hot Toast.
